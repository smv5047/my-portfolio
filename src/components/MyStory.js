          I'm a Dad, DJ, and Developer. As a Full-Stack Developer I've built
          projects using React, Node, Vanilla JS, PostgreSQL and Python. I have
          extensive project management experience across enterprises large and
          small. From public companies to startups I've worked with
          cross-functional teams to deliver security and IT projects timely and
          on budget. I'm looking forward to my next challenge as a Developer.
